# Manny
# Agent Workflows Project

I am Woof and I will be starting a development project of some AI software for phones, but starting as a web app in order to focus on the internal functionality and db backend rather than the display container. So, it might be a great idea to make sure all the functionality can be utilized in different containers from the get-go. As such, a modular framework will be used for the software development, and it will be designed to be display agnostic. I have also decided to make it with open-source software as components. The system is designed with multiple agents in autonimous workflows.

I will be tracking project timelines and roadmap with the Agent Workflows project in the stonebridgeco githib. 

Manny is an AU that tells you answers to maintenance questions. The AI is trained with 1000s of manufacturer manuals and expert comments. 

Ask a question about the instructions to any available appliance and Manny will tell you the answer and maybe give you a diagram. 



I'm starting with a Streamlit fromt end because it seems easy. So I make the front end, check that it works and containerize it so it can be shared as a linked app with codebase. I'll try to leave a decent log and upgrade and standardize things as I go. This is the start of the project and I will share the process often here.

Best regards, Woof
